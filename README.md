## Background
The following is a dataset for a city's school district where the data will be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I've been given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance comparing school types (district or charter), scores, sizes, and more.
